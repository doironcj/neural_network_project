# neural_network_project
This is a neural network project written in python for a machine learning course. This repository includes Python code for my own implementation of a neural network and the scikit-learn version. Although my implementation runs much slower, both implementations obtain around 70+% accuracy after training on separate data. Results could be improved by adjustments to the learning parameters and node amounts. I have not tested these results on different datasets.
